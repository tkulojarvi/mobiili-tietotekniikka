- How did you get your app to trigger a notification while it's not in the foreground?
I didn't manage to implement this feature.

- How did you make the notification interactable?

notificationService.showNotification() method is triggered when the "Show Notification" button is clicked. 
In the Notification class, an Intent is created, specifying that clicking the notification should open the MainActivity.
Also a PendingIntent is created. It represents the operation of launching the MainActivity. 
When the user clicks the notification, it will trigger the specified PendingIntent, which opens the MainActivity.

- What does clicking the notification do?
It launches the app.

- What sensor are you using and how are you reading its values in the background?

Accelerometer sensor is used to capture accelerometer values.
The accelerometer sensor is obtained using sensorManager.getDefaultSensor(Sensor.TYPE_ACCELEROMETER).
AccelerometerViewModel class has _accelerometerValues that is used to hold the accelerometer values.
onSensorChanged function in the sensorListener updates the accelerometer values.
onSensorChanged gets called whenever the accelerometer sensor reports a new set of values.

I used the Android Studio emulator to change the sensor values in the video.

- What are you using the sensor input for?
The accelerometer values are simply displayed on screen.
