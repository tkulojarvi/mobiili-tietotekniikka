HW3 Teemu Kuloj√§rvi

New navigation system was created by ChatGPT. I couldn't get the navigation from the previous homework to work despite trying.

1. How did you implement picking an image?
- Image is picked by using a TextField for entering an image URL. The TextField is part of the LoginPage composable. URL is stored in viewModel.url. Then in MessageCard composable the viewModel.url is used.

2. How did you implement text input?
- Text input is handled with a TextField in the LoginPage composable.

3. How can you store the data such that the application can display your chosen image and text even when you change views or restart the application?
- I did not implement saving the image.


**UPDATE**

I updated the Homework so that the image shows up when selecting the URL in the Login screen.
